# Where's Waldo?
* This is my take on the "Where's Waldo" project from "The Odin Project" course, Javascript path, BaaS subject.
* The stack used: Typescript, ReactJS, Google's Firebase and TailwindCSS.
* For this project to work, it's needed to add a firebase-configuration file to root.
## The Objective
* To create a photo tagging app where the user will have to tag characters in a confusing background. 
* To keep track of user's time until all subjects are tagged.
* To use Firebase Auth to allow identified users to register their records if they are in the top 10 quickest.
* To use Firebase Firestore to persist the records data and other resources.
## To improve
* Write tests for the functions and for the react user flow.
* Better style the application.
* Increase the number of images and difficulty.
